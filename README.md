# Crafting Interpreters 

This project is my attempt to learn Ruby by 
building the Lox interpreter from [Crafting 
Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com). 

This project uses ruby 2.7 to run. I might 
switch to building it in ruby 3+ at a later
date. The goal is to learn about interpreters
while also getting comfortable with the ruby 
language. 

The tree walking interpreter is using
ruby. When the book switches to using a lower
level language, I will switch to a statically 
compiled language maybe Janet, Crystal, or Nim.
